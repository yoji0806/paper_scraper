# Potential Bugs

Plaese take note below, if you find anything can be a bug in the future.  
And keep these in mind, when you develop new codes.  


## dealing with DOI(Digital Object Identifier)

We replace the slash mark(/) with an underscore(_) in DOI because of DB issues.   
This could be a bug when a new journal's DOI name contains a slash mark(/).
